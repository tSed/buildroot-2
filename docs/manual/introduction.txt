About Buildroot
===============

Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of
building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
cross-compilation.

In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a
cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any
combination of these options, independently (you can for example use
an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root
filesystem with Buildroot).

Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.

Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
comes with default configurations for several boards available
off-the-shelf. Besides this, a number of third-party projects are based on,
or develop their BSP footnote:[BSP: Board Support Package] or
SDK footnote:[SDK: Software Development Kit] on top of Buildroot.

What is Buildroot and what is it not
------------------------------------

Buildroot is:

* a community-driven project;
* a tool used in the industry;
* targeting embedded, rather small, often headless, devices.


Buildroot is *not*:

* a _classic Linux-based distribution_, this means:

** Buildroot does not use any package manager to populate the root
   filesystem, this means there is no way to update only one package
   of a root filesystem built by Buildroot without regenerating the
   whole root filesystem;
** Buildroot does not keep track of each package's content;
** Buildroot does not provide as many packages as others distributions
   do; so, some packages may not be available yet because the
   community does not need them or thinks they are not suitable for
   embedded targets.

* Root filesystems generated by Buildroot are not intended to be used
  for native development; so they do not contain any development file
  (no headers, no static libraries, no native compiler for the
  target), nor documentation.

Buildroot's principles
----------------------

* Easy to use
* Fast to build
* Small footprint of the generated images footnote:[the smallness of
  the image footprint mostly depends on the target device and its
  application(s)]
* Easy to hack
* Being generic, but allowing customization:

** Provide support for SoCs, rather than board specific configuration
   (though Buildroot comes with a set of default configurations for a
   bunch of boards);
** Provide default configurations that can be easily overriden.
