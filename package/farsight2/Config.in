	  The Farsight (new version named Farstream) project is an effort to
	  create a framework to deal with all known audio/video conferencing
	  protocols. On one side it offers a generic API that makes it possible
	  to write plugins for different streaming protocols, on the other side
	  it offers an API for clients to use those plugins.
